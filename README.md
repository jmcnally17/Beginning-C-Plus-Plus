# C++

This is a set of simple programs I've made while working through the Codecadamy course to learn how to code in C++. Each directory was made to practice a specific part of basic C++ and are as follows:

- Hello: simple output messages to the terminal
- Calculation: basic maths operation
- LeapYear: if statements
- WeightInSpace: switch statement
- NinetyNineBottles: for loop
- VectorOfNumbers: a simple use of a vector
- Chocolate: header file with two .cpp files
- Song: a class
